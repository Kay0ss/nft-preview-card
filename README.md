### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that although some of these styling challenges seem very easy and like they will only take about an hour, sometimes you run into bugs and it takes quite a bit longer, also I learned not to take advantage of how easy I see basic html and css styling to be.

### Continued development

I would like to integrate react into this challenge and fine tune some of my styling aspects in the future.
